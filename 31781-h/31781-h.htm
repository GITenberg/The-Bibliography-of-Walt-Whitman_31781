<p class="poem">
"Camerado, this is no book;<br />
Who touches this touches a man."</p>

<p>Walt Whitman's relation to his work was more personal than that of most
poets. He was, in a larger sense, a man of one book, and this book,
issued and reissued at various periods of the poet's life, was, at each
issuance, the latest expression of his development. The infinite care he
gave to his work; the continual study of each poem resulted in changes
in each edition. The book literally grew with the man and in the present
authorized edition of today we have his final and complete utterance.</p>

<p>Whitman's early fugitive work presents to the student a curious anomaly.
It gives no intimation of the great nature that later produced Leaves of
Grass and Democratic Vistas. In quality it was beneath the standards of
the nickle-dreadfuls of yesterday. Bearing such titles as "One Wicked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Impulse"; "Revenge and Requital, Tale of a Murderer Escaped"; "The
Angel of Tears"; (many of them are in the Prose Works) they appealed to
a class to whom thought was anathema and reading solely a pastime. They
are didactic to the extreme, presenting the horrible results of sin and
the corresponding rewards of virtue. Their value as literature, however,
does not come within the province of the bibliographer.</p>

<p>The care Whitman bestowed upon his writings was carried to the
mechanical production of his books. Each edition was manufactured under
his supervision and when completed represented the latest and highest
achievements in commercial bookmaking. Further, he took such an intense
personal interest in the sale of his books that he invariably knew at
all times the number of copies sold and the number on hand.</p>

<p>The first edition comprised three distinct variations. The first of
these, in paper wrappers, are undoubtedly the result of Whitman's
impatience at the delays of the binder. Considering that he had a press
at his disposal, it is not assuming too much to suggest that while
awaiting deliveries from the binder he printed the jackets himself for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>immediate use. This is the only way to account for the existence of the
paper copies. Further proof that this contention is correct is that each
copy bears an inscription in Whitman's holograph.</p>

<p>Though Whitman insisted that "the entire edition sold readily" there is
little doubt he meant circulated. In fact, they were circulated so
rapidly a new edition was required within ten months. This second
edition was a dumpy sexto-decimo of nearly four hundred pages. Twenty
new poems were added, one of the earlier poems was dropped and all were
retouched. This edition did sell rapidly and only fear of public
criticism prevented the publishers from reissuing the book. The failure
to find a firm to stand sponsor for his book discouraged Whitman to the
extent of planning to go West and pioneer. His plans for this venture
were completed when Thayer and Eldridge opened negotiations for the
book's republication with any new material available. This offer took
the poet to Boston to oversee the work and in May, 1860, a substantial
volume, with many new poems came from the press. The book went through
two editions, a total of between thirty-five hundred and four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
copies when the publishers failed. The plates were sold at auction and
went to a notorious pirate, who, within the next ten years, published
and sold over ten thousand copies. Whitman had no control over these
crimped editions and forever after they were a torment to him.</p>

<p>It was not until after the Civil War that a new authentic edition was
published&mdash;again without a publisher. In later issues of this edition
Whitman bound in the sheets of "Drum-Taps" and "When Lilacs Last in the
Dooryard Bloom'd," and in still later issues, "Songs Before Parting."
The total number of copies issued is not known but must have been quite
small owing to the effect of the lower priced pirated edition.</p>

<p>The fifth edition was published in Washington and attracted little or no
attention save in England where the demand for complete and unabridged
copies was fostered by Rossetti's emasculated edition. The English
demand was so great that Whitman was compelled to reprint one or two new
editions. He got around the expense of new plates by inserting
"intercallations"&mdash;poems printed on separate slips of paper and tipped
in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1881, the next Boston edition was issued. With a recognized publisher
of Osgood's standing there should have been no question of the final
success of "Leaves of Grass." Osgood published all the work of the New
Englanders; Longfellow, Lowell, Emerson and Whittier. Whitman was in
good company save that the Society for the Suppression of Vice
considered "Leaves of Grass" to be bad company and through District
Attorney Stevens secured its suppression. Osgood promptly withdrew the
book and gladly turned over to the author all unsold and unbound copies
and the plates. The plates went to Rees, Welsh and Company, of
Philadelphia, who brought out an edition and then dropped from sight.
David McKay published an edition from the same plates. During this time
certain "special" and "author's" editions were published by Whitman as
his own publisher.</p>

<p>After Whitman's death Small, Maynard &amp; Company, of Boston, became the
authorized publishers. They were followed in turn by D. Appleton and
Company, and Mitchell Kennerley. At this writing Messrs. Doubleday, Page
&amp; Co. are the authorized publishers of "Leaves of Grass," and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
"Prose Works."</p>

<p>Any bibliography of Whitman's Works can be called but an attempt. His
temperamental handling of the plates of the various editions of "Leaves
of Grass" resulted in many curious imprints. There may be omissions, I
grant, but not serious ones. The work I undertook was a clearing up of
the fog which hung about the various Boston editions and setting
cataloguers right on the first edition.</p>

<p>I must, at this point, thank Anne Montgomerie Traubel, of Camden, Mr.
Walter Bartley Quinlan and Mr. Alfred F. Goldsmith, of New York, and Mr.
Henry S. Saunders, of Toronto, Canada, for valuable suggestions and
comparison of notes, and Mr. M. M. Breslow for permission to use his
very excellent collection of Whitmaniana as a basis for this
bibliography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrangement is chronological, the only practicable method.</p>

<p>In listing titles and imprints I have sought to follow the typography
and punctuation of the originals. Where this was not practicable I have
inserted punctuation marks to give the matter coherence. Where I have
interpolated remarks or descriptions within the titles I have enclosed
them in brackets to distinguish them from Whitman's parenthesis.</p>

<p>The New World. Extra Series. Number 34. New York, November, 1842.
Original Temperance Novel. Franklin Evans; or The Inebriate. A Tale of
the Times. By Walter Whitman.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Royal octavo, pp. 31, uncut.</p>

<p>Published as an extra to "<i>The New World</i>."</p>

<p>The last page (32) contains advertisement: "New Works in Press."</p>

<p>Written during Whitman's Bohemian days it was advertised as a
thrilling romance by one of the best novelists in this country
and had a sale of between 20,000 and 25,000 copies, which netted
the author about $200. References to the work in later years
irritated Whitman and he refused to discuss it. The work is
extremely scarce considering the great number that were
published.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="small">1855</h2>

<p>Leaves of Grass. Brooklyn, New York. 1855.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>First edition. Twelve poems.</p>

<p>Imperial octavo, pink paper wrappers.</p>

<p>"Leaves of Grass" printed in block letters across front wrapper,
end wrapper blank. Steel engraved portrait, title, uncaptioned
preface, xii, Leaves of Grass, pp. 95, end blank.</p>

<p>The author's name appears only in the copyright notice, and in
the first poem: "Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a
kosmos."</p>

<p>The poems, twelve in number, are without titles. In the present
authorized edition they appear under the following titles:</p>

<p class="list">
Song of Myself.<br />
A Song for Occupations.<br />
To Think of Time.<br />
The Sleepers.<br />
I Sing the Body Electric.<br />
Faces.<br />
Song of the Answer (part one).<br />
Europe.<br />
A Boston Ballad.<br />
There Was a Child Went Forth.<br />
Who Learns My Lesson Complete.<br />
Great Are the Myths.<br />
</p>

<p>The preface was later worked into three poems:</p>

<p class="list">
By Blue Ontario's Shore.<br />
Song of Prudence.<br />
To a Foil'd European Revolutionaire.<br />
</p>

<p>There are three variations of the first edition. The one noted
above in pink wrappers is unquestionably the first issue. The
second issue is bound in green cloth, gilt edges, and with the
title stamped in rustic letters in gilt on the front cover. The
last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> issue of this edition has all the points of the second
issue with eight pages of press notices bound in at the front.</p>

<p>Less than nine hundred copies were printed in July, 1855, in the
printshop of Andrew H. Rome, 98 Cranberry Street, Brooklyn, the
author assisting in the type composition and presswork. The
volume was placed on sale at Fowler &amp; Wells, Broadway, New York,
and at Swaynes, in Fulton Street, Brooklyn, at two dollars, but
was later reduced to one dollar. Very few copies were sold;
Whitman giving almost the entire edition to critics and friends.</p>

<p>Catalogued from the Maier copy.</p>
</div>

<p class="space">A reprint of this edition was issued in January, 1920, by Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher, Portland, Maine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="small">1856</h2>

<p>Leaves of Grass. Brooklyn, New York. 1856.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Second edition. Thirty-two poems.</p>

<p>Thick 16mo, green drab cloth, sprinkled edges. Title stamped in
gilt on face of binding; on back title and quotation from
Emerson's letter "I Greet You at the Beginning of a Great
Career, R. W. Emerson," portrait, same as in the first edition,
title, contents, iv, Leaves of Grass, pp. (5)-342, Leaves
Droppings (reprint of Emerson's letter; Whitman's letter to
Emerson and press notices), pp. 345-384, advertisement. Owing to
the storm of criticism which arose against the book, Fowler &amp;
Wells, the New York publishers, refused to put their name on the
title page, and though they attended to all the details of
presswork and distribution, the volume was issued from Brooklyn,
without imprint. It is said that there are copies in existence
bearing Fowler &amp; Wells imprint, but this is doubtful as such
copies are unknown to Whitman collectors. In this edition the
prose preface of the first edition is worked into four poems: By
Blue Ontario's Shore; Song of the Answerer, part two; To a
Foil'd European Revolutionaire, and Song of Prudence; the
balance being reprinted in Specimen Days and Collect, 1881.</p>

<p>Owing to the refusal of Fowler &amp; Wells to stand sponsor to the
volume, only 1,000 copies were printed and the book was out of
print 1858-1860.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

Grass." Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>18mo, printed wrappers, pp. 64.</p>

<p>A reprint of current criticisms of the first and second
editions. Pp. 7, 30, 38, contain articles written and
contributed anonymously by Whitman to various New York papers.
They were later reprinted in the Fellowship papers and in In Re
Walt Whitman, 1893.</p>

<h2 class="small">1860</h2>

<p>Leaves of Grass. Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, Year '85 of The States.
(1860-61.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Third edition. 154 poems.</p>

<p>Duodecimo, brown cloth, heavily blind embossed. Portrait, at the
age of forty, engraved by Schoff, after the painting by Charles
Hine, in 1859, on an irregular tinted background, title,
contents, pp. iv-456.</p>

<p>Issued May, 1860. The author went to Boston to superintend
the printing and binding. The publishers failed during the
period of financial depression at the beginning of the Civil War
and the plates were sold at auction to R. Worthington, who
surreptitiously used them with the original imprint. There are,
for this reason, four or more editions bearing the original
Thayer and Eldridge imprint. The first issue is distinguished by
the engraved portrait which is on an irregular tinted background
and by the gilt embossed butterfly on the backbone of the
binding. On the verso of the title is the inscription
"Electrotyped at the Boston Stereotype Foundry. Printed by
George C. Rand &amp; Avery." The second issue has the portrait on
white paper and lacks the gilt butterfly. The third issue, or
the first pirated issue, lacks the printer's inscription and is
bound in cheap cloth. Early issues, all spurious, contain
catalogues of Worthington's publications bound in at the end.
The plates were purchased by Whitman's literary executors after
his death.</p>

<p>In this edition the author abandons calling the months by their
common names and adopts the Quaker style: that of calling
September the Ninthmonth, etc.</p>

<p>Copies of the first issue with the tinted portrait are extremely
scarce. The various editions have heretofore remained
undistinguished.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Duodecimo, brown cloth, title (Drum-Taps) stamped on gold ground
on front cover, title, contents, iv, pp. 5-72.</p>

<p>But few copies had been issued when the death of President
Lincoln occurred and the author withheld the balance until a few
weeks later when he added "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard
Bloom'd and other Pieces," with pagination distinct from that of
Drum-Taps, as a sequel. This and the "Sequel" formed the first
and second annexes to the fourth edition, 1867, of Leaves of
Grass, and were later incorporated in the Washington, 1871
edition under the title of Drum-Taps. Copies without the
"sequel" are exceedingly scarce.</p>

Walt Whitman and his Poems, pp. 13-21.<br />
Leaves of Grass: a volume of poems just published, pp. 23-26.<br />
An English and an American Poet, pp. 27-32.<br />
Letters in Sickness: Washington, 1873, pp. 73-92.<br />
</p>

<p>The first three articles were written by Whitman during 1855-56
and sent to the newspapers anonymously. He insisted that
considering the misunderstanding and abuse accorded to Leaves of
Grass, he was compelled to resort to these methods to defend his
work in columns that would have been otherwise closed to him.
The latter was a series of letters to his mother.</p>

materials, for I think they are the most spiritual poems, and I will
make the poems of my body and mortality. Done into print by the
Roycrofters at their shop which is in East Aurora, New York, A.D.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
